The game only has one code. the code "KALJAKOPPA" opens all tracks, cars and races. Write KALJAKOPPA for your name and you'll hear a sound and you can put your name again.

General tips for driving
<br>
<br>
I've driven Rally Trophy a lot since it came to stores, so I believe I know what im talking about, because I have a lot of playtime and my placings on the rankings page are with the top 10 best. (This isn't bragging it meant, that I know what I am takling about) these tips are meant for rear wheel driving cars in Rally Trophyssa, front wheel driving cars should be easy to control for everyone. Altough everyone probably has their own driving style and these are just my tips for driving. However I've gotten some nice results with these. General tips are maybe meant more for the new players. Adjustement tips tell you how you should Adjust the car when wanting daredevil times.

General Driving

1) Generally try to keep the car quite straight, and dont go too much into a slide. There are two exceptions to this "rule". With a strong "throw" into the slide you can kill your extra speed before a turn if done right. A good example turn, where you can kill your extra speed is on Russia SS1's "left-right" turn combination, before the 90 degree intersection. This way of "killing" your speed mostly works on gravel. The other exception with avoiding sliding is driving on snow, in long turns you should give more gas pedal and let the back of the car go with the slide. with this you can keep the speed and the slide keeps the front in the inner turn and you can drive faster. This rule only works on snow, with a controlled, long, can win time on long turns. When you learn to controll the back of the car well, a small slide might be good here and there, but these apply when you are starting.
