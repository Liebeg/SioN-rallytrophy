<h2>Tips from the Text file that comes with the game</h2>
<p>
Tips & Hints:<br>
Front wheel driving tips:<br>
<br>
Front wheel drive (or, according to some, 'wrong wheel drive') is easiest to drive but can be tricky to master. Whether you apply throttle or steer, all the controlling forces affect front wheels only. The main thing to keep in mind with front wheel drive is that in the corners it understeers as the front wheels spin and lose traction. This is where left-foot braking or scandinavian flick techniques kicks in.<br>
<br>
Left-foot braking:<br>
By carefully braking while keeping the revs up, you can partially or fully lock the rear wheels and throw the tail of your car for a spin, allowing you to complete a tight curve with higher speed than normally.<br>
<br>
Scandinavian Flick:<br>
Using the left-foot braking technique, you flip your car into a 4-wheel slide heading away from the bend. Upon reaching the turn, coming off the brakes while steering towards the turn results in a oversteer which flips the car through the curve, but only if you master the timing of the brakes, steering and throttle applications. Very tricky but if you get the hang of it, it can seriously help your stage times.<br>
<br>
Rear wheel driving tips:<br>
<br>
Rear wheel drive (sometimes referred to as 'correct wheel drive'..) is considered best by the majority of drivers. You have separate control over both ends of the car and this gives room for a variety of techniques. It is important to keep in mind that throttle control in the curves is absolutely essential! Too much or too little causes the car to spin very easily.<br>
<br>
Power sliding:<br>
Power slide is essentially reducing traction on the rear wheels while keeping the front-end in control, letting the car slide throughout the corner attaining higher speeds than normal. It is essential in rallying and requires some practice to get it right as you're controlling the car angle with your gas pedal.<br>
